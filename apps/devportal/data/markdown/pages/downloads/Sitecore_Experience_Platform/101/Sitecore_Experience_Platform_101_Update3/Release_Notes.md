## Highlights

Sitecore Experience Platform 10.1.3 includes:

- The media item duplication logic has been updated to resolve issues when deleting duplicates of a media item that shared the same blob. Now, duplicating a media item creates a duplicate of a blob. After upgrading to this version, you must run the `/sitecore/admin/duplicates.aspx` admin page to ensure all duplicate media items in your solution refer to a blob copy, not a shared one.
