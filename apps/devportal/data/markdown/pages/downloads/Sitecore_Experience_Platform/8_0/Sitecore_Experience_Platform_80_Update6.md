-   Sitecore strongly urges customers on earlier versions of 8.0 to upgrade to 8.0 update-6 at the earliest possible opportunity.
-   Please note — although you will find all the new documentation for Sitecore 8 on [the Documentation site](http://doc.sitecore.net), much of the [SDN documentation for 7.0 - 7.5](http://sdn.sitecore.net/Reference/Sitecore%207) is still relevant. SDN documentation is in the process of being converted and migrated.
