-   Note: This is a product Service Pack, originally released as 8.0 Update-7. Sitecore recommends customers to install service packs for any feature release that the customer has installed. This is especially true in production environments.
-   Note: xDB Cloud support will follow approximately 6 weeks after the release of this update
-   Although you will find all the new documentation for Sitecore 8 on [the Documentation site](http://doc.sitecore.net), much of the [SDN documentation for 7.0 - 7.5](http://sdn.sitecore.net/Reference/Sitecore%207) is still relevant. SDN documentation is in the process of being converted and migrated.
