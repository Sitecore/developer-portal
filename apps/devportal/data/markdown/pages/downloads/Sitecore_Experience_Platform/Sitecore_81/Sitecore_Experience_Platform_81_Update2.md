# Sitecore Experience Platform 8.1 Update-2

Sitecore 8.1 is a comprehensive improvement to Sitecore 8.0 and incorporates all of the feedback that we have received from customers, partners, and analysts since Sitecore 8.0 was released. Heavy investment in product quality, stability and usability can be found throughout 8.1 to help our customers take advantage of Context Marketing and engage in full brand experience management. For further details into the specific enhancements of 8.1, please see the Release Notes.

This page contains all the resources for **Sitecore Experience Platform 8.1 rev. 160302 (8.1 Update-2)**.

-   Note: xDB Cloud support will follow approximately 6 weeks after the release of this update.
-   Sitecore 8.1 now requires a license with the “Sitecore.xDB.base” key to enable all features of the Experience Platform. If your license file does not contain this key, Sitecore will default to Experience Management (CMS-only) mode. Any customers or partners with a license to Experience Platform should contact their account manager or [login to SPN](http://spn.sitecore.net/default) if they are missing this key.
