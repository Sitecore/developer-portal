## Highlights

Sitecore Experience Platform (SXP) 10.4 includes updates for improved security, prolonged supportability, performance, and usability. Highlights include:

- Updated Javascript libraries throughout SXP components.
- Improved security hardening throughout SXP to decrease risks due to vulnerabilities.
- Updated 3rd party compatibility: SQL Server 2022, latest Azure Kubernetes Service.
- Improved accessibility - enabling content authors with poor vision to better manage content in the Content Editor. For example, you can now:
  - Navigate the ribbon and use these actions: create, rename, move, and delete items
  - Navigate and expand items in the content tree.
  - Navigate and select various types of fields in the content area.
  - Listen to information about UI elements through assistve third-party technology.
- Implemented Solr soft commits to make index changes visible to search.
- Added a new *​Sitecore Client Content Reader*​​ user role that grants read access to Content Tree items in the Content Editor and Media Library.
- Added the ability to create a custom or regional language directly in the Content Editor, such as `en-EU`, which extends beyond those ISO language formats that are registered in .NET.
- Added the ability to trigger campaigns or goals based on rules. This is relevant, for example, if you want to display content from a campaign when certain pages are visited.
- Added the ability to bulk assign marketing definitions in xDB to content, improving the usability and efficiency in associate a marketing campaign to multiple content items at the same time.
- Added a new `Codeless Schema Extension` module, enabling business users to extend the xConnect schema without requiring code development.
- Added an open source module with the ability to extract data from xDB and transform the schema to feed external analytics tools. This also includes templates that show how the reports can be recreated in Power BI.

In addition, our SXP 10.4 release adds flexibility in interworking with new SaaS products across Sitecore's portfolio and with the community ecosystem, enabling our current customers to continue with existing investments in SXP, while innovating on their own pace with Sitecore's other SaaS-based products. Related tooling released along with SXP 10.4 include:

- XM to XM Cloud Migration Tool for migrating content, media, and users from a source XM instance to an XM Cloud environment. This tool provides an aid for the routine and sometimes recurring back-end migrations, so our customers/partners can focus on migrating developing new front-end sites.
- xDB to CDP Migration Tool for transferring site visitor contact facets to Sitecore's CDP and Personalize products, and also via Sitecore Connect to external systems. This provides the ability to interwork with or eventually adopt other SaaS based innovation.

Important Change:

- Media item duplication logic has been updated to resolve issues when deleting duplicates of a media item that shares the same blob. Now, duplicating a media item creates a duplicate of a blob. After upgrading to this version, you must run the
`/sitecore/admin/duplicates.aspx` admin page to ensure all duplicate media items in your solution refer to a blob copy, not a shared one. Ref: ADO no. 563054 (below in Resolved Issues / Media).
