## Highlights

Sitecore Experience Platform (SXP) 10.3 delivers new capabilities and quality improvements that enable organizations to deliver unforgettable experiences with increased ease and convenience.

Whether self-hosted, implemented in Sitecore Managed Cloud, or used as Experience Manager (XM) through Sitecore Experience Manager Cloud (XM Cloud), the 10.3 release improves how organizations extend and integrate the Sitecore Experience Platform with other applications in their marketing tech stack. New management and administration APIs and webhooks enable developers to take an API-first and industry-standard approach to customization, reducing the reliance on in-process custom code. This separation makes it easier for developers to upgrade to new versions of the Experience Platform in the future.

Additionally, the introduction of Headless SXA, Headless Services 21.0, and enhancements to developer tools with 10.3 makes it easier for organizations to use SXP as a headless CMS, and to build engaging experiences using modern front-end frameworks.

Other highlights include:

- Headless SXA: Benefit from site scaffolding and templating, and new Next.js components, when building applications with XM as a headless CMS.
- ​​​​EXM enhancements: Added OAuth support for custom SMTP deployments.
- ​​​​​Headless Services 21.0: Includes the new starter framework to accelerate the creation of new projects, and support for Next.js 12.3.x and React 18.
- ​​​​​Management Services 5.0: Enhanced Experience Edge publishing, resolved default publishing target, and added support for single-item publishing.
- ​​Sitecore CLI 5.0: Added Linux support and new telemetry.
- System updates: Upgraded Identity Server and Publishing Service to support .NET 6, added support for Solr 8.11.2, and SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for encryption of data at rest. Support for Windows Server 2022 coming in January.
