Sitecore Experience Commerce (XC) 10.1 is compatible with Sitecore Experience Platform (XP) 10.1, 10.1 Update-1, 10.1 Update-2, and 10.1 Update-3. Compatibility with XP 10.1 Update-2 requires updating an XC host file for connecting to Identity Server as described in [KB1000801](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1000801).

For containers deployments retrieve the applicable Sitecore Commerce Containers SDK version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Sitecore/container-deployment/releases) for compatibility with the correct XP update release. 

Sitecore XC 10.1 adds functional enhancements like data archiving of orders-related entities, performance enhancements focusing on optimizing the commerce redis cache, and robustness improvements and corrections. 

Refer to the [Sitecore Experience Commerce Compatibility Table](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/804595) for the software and version prerequisites.
