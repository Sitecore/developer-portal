**Going to XP2XMP requires also switch to Managed Cloud?**

No. The customer can bring their environment over as part of the deal, but this is not a prerequisite, they can pair SaaS (Personalize) with their existing XM installation.

**What are the limitations of hosting on Managed Cloud? Can we cover all our current markets in regard to data privacy and governance laws?**

Yes, provided that the data center provider has these options. For example, AWS and Azure are the target partners with Azure being the primary partner now.
