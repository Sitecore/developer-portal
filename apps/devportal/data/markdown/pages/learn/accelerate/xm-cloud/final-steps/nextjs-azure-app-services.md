## Problem

Customers are considering hosting their XM Cloud Next.js front end on Azure App Services. 

## Solution

Sitecore does not recommend hosting your XM Cloud head application on Azure App Services. This applies to both Node and Docker web apps in Azure App Services. 

The main reason for not recommending Azure App Services is that it takes a server infrastructure approach to hosting, leading to lower performance, difficulty scaling, and higher management complexity.

For more information on server infrastructure versus Sitecoreâ€™s recommended serverless hosting infrastructure, review the Serverless vs. Server Hosting Infrastructure recipe. Sitecore recommends technology partners and serverless hosting solutions [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

### Performance Limitations
One of Azure App Services' biggest limitations is performance. Since Next.js is a JavaScript application and JavaScript is a single-threaded language, the Node.js runtime for JavaScript is also single-threaded. This means that the single-threaded Node server has to handle all requests to your websites, Experience Edge, image optimization, incremental static regeneration, and more, leading to performance issues.

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is often suggested as a solution to Node.js performance issues. However, using this tool adds more complexity, and it has not been established whether it improves performance in an XM Cloud front-end hosting solution.

### Scalability Limitations
Efficient scaling requires a content delivery network (CDN). However, Azure App Services does not come with a CDN by default.

Azure does offer the Azure Content Delivery Network service, but you must manage the endpoint and caching. This leads to further increased complexity. 

### Azure App Services Specific Limitations
Network Connection Limits

A specific limitation of Azure App Services that XM Cloud customers have experienced is the limited network port capacity for outbound network calls. Customers have hit the network connection limits' upper bounds, leading to severe performance degradation. 

Review the [Inside the Azure App Service Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/february/azure-inside-the-azure-app-service-architecture#network-port-capacity-for-outbound-network-calls) article for additional information on Azure App Services network limitations.
