## Introduction

The Sitecore Developer Collection was created by developers, for developers, to eliminate down time and headaches when working with Sitecore. The suite of tools allows your team to automate builds and deployments, easily compare and merge databases, and collaborate more efficiently. This incredibly feature-rich tool set is highly adaptable and easily customized to fit your project.

## Sitecore CLI

Sitecore CLI provides a command line interface to interact with your Sitecore instance. This command line provides technical team members with automation capabilities and the ability to do content serialization, indexing, publishing, and more.

## Sitecore for Visual Studio

Sitecore for Visual Studio provides a graphical tool to interact with your Sitecore instance from within Visual Studio. This provides the same capabilities as CLI but makes it more accessible to users who are unfamiliar with command line tools. By using a remote rendering host, developers can build straight from Visual Studio into the rendering host and test changes without needing to recycle Sitecore every time. Make quick changes to the presentation layer, push those changes, and debug in a fraction of the time.

## Razl

Razl allows developers to have a complete side by side comparison between two Sitecore databases, highlighting features that are missing or not up to date. Users can easily move missing items from one database to another.

Whether it's finding that one missing template, moving an entire database or shifting just one item, Razl allows developers to do it seamlessly.

## Feydra

Front-end developers convert designs using a variety of front-end tools that generate HTML and CSS. Front-end developers then pass this work to back-end developers, who convert the code to a Sitecore component. Feydra eliminates the traditional serial implementation process and reduces the overall development timeline.
