## About this portal

The Sitecore developer portal is built using Next.js and Chakra UI, and is hosted on Vercel. The application uses static site generation to create all the pages at build time. It also utilizes Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to automatically update the app when changes to page content are made. Much of the page content is written in Markdown and is converted to HTML at build time. Images that are used are managed in Sitecore DAM and are published to a CDN.

All code for this project can be found in the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sitecore/developer-portal).

## Build Prerequisites

### Node.js

The developer portal is built with Next.js, so you'll need to have Node.js installed to build the project. You can find the latest version of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using the LTS version of Node.js.

### Environment Variables

The Sitecore developer portal incorporates a number of third party services to bring in content. For full functionality, you must create a **.env.local** file in the root of the project and add in the below environment variables.

The following variables should exist within the .env.local file:

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY="An API key with YouTube Data API v3 access enabled"
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN="A bearer token from Twitter "
```

_Note: The site will still function without the above keys. The components that require these environment variables will fail gracefully and not display on the pages._

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), we recommend the LTS version.
2. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/Sitecore/developer-portal.git`
3. Inside the repository run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=""
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=""
```

(For more information on populating environment variables see section **Environment Variables** above.)

5.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
6.  Open the **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to see the result!
