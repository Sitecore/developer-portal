# ![Sitecore logo in red background](https://github.com/Sitecore/developer-portal/raw/main/apps/devportal/public/favicon-32x32.png) Sitecore Developer Portal

Welcome to the Sitecore Developer Portal repository. This app was created to help you get started with Sitecore. The developer portal aims to bring all the Sitecore developer tools together in one place.

## Technology used

The Sitecore developer portal is built with Next.js, Typescript, Chakra UI and [Sitecore Blok](https://blok.sitecore.com), managed using Turborepo and is hosted on Vercel. The app uses static site generation to create all the pages at build time. It also utilizes Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to automatically update the app when changes to page content are made. Much of the page content is written in Markdown and is converted to HTML at build time. Images that are used are managed in Sitecore DAM and are published to a CDN.

### Apps and Packages

- apps
  - `devportal`: Developer Portal public site ([Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based)
- packages
  - `@scdp/ui`: a React component library based on [Sitecore Blok](https://blok.sitecore.com) used by `devportal` application
  - `@scdp/changelog`: Custom library to retrieve and parse changelog data
  - `@scdp/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
  - `@scdp/jest-presets`: `jest` configuration used throughout the monorepo
  - `@scdp/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Prerequisites

#### Monorepo

This repository is utilizing Turborepo to manage our monorepo setup. More information about Monorepos can be found in the [Monorepo Handbook](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook).

#### Node.js

The developer portal is built with Next.js, so you'll need to have Node.js installed to build the project. You can find the latest version of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using the LTS version of Node.js.

#### Environment Variables

The Sitecore developer portal incorporates a number of third party services to bring in content. For full functionality, you must create a **.env.local** file in the root of the project and add in the below environment variables. Use the `.env.template` file as a starting point.

The following variables should exist within the .env.local file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY="An API key with YouTube Data API v3 access enabled"
NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_CONSENT_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_AUTH=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ENVIRONMENT=
```

_Note: The site will still function without the above keys. The components that require these environment variables will fail gracefully and not display on the pages._

---

To enable search the following environment variables are required:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_CUSTOMER_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_ENV=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_ENABLE_PREVIEW_SEARCH=
```

_Note: The site will still function if the keys are missing or left blank. However these keys are still required to build the application_

---

To enable Sitecore CDP/Personalize to capture events the following environment variables are required:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_CLIENT_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_TARGETURL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_COOKIE_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_POS=
```

\_Note: The site will still function if the keys are missing or left blank.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), we recommend the LTS version.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Inside the repository run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project from the `.env.template` file. The following environment variables should be included:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_COOKIE_CONSENT_URL=

NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_AUTH=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM_ENVIRONMENT=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_CUSTOMER_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_APP_ENV=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SEARCH_ENABLE_PREVIEW_SEARCH=

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_CLIENT_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_TARGETURL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_COOKIE_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_CDP_POS=
```

(For more information on populating environment variables see section **Environment Variables** above.)

5.  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
6.  Open the **http://localhost:3000** in your browser to see the result!
