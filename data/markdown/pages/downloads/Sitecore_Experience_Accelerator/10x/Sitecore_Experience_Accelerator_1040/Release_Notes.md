| When `ItemCloning.ForceUpdate` is disabled, cloning an item from one site to another and creating a second version and modifying it doesn't update its fields. When enabled, it causes the following: `(1)` Cloning an item from one site to another and creating a second version adds a third version to the cloned item. `(2)` Adding an item to another with clones in other sites results in an error, instead of the item being cloned across sites. | 596032, 594404, 595513         |
