SXA provides reusable user experience layouts and components that are fully integrated into the Sitecore editing experience.

| The OpenGraph component renders an incorrect image media URL if the target hostname is set.                                                                        | 453945 |

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| An `ArgumentNullException` occurs when an item defined in the `Pass Through Field` does not contain any value.                                                                                                                                           | 334632 |
| If a partial design contains a container rendering, you cannot save any changes that you make to the rendering.                                                                                                                                          | 316029 |
| ​If you search using a date filter, the search results do not include the day specified in the `To date` value.                                                                                                                                           | 242338 |
| If you use the `Load More` component, all the search results are not shown.                                                                                                                                                                              | 334643 |
| The `Pagination` component does not work when it is embedded within a rendering variant.                                                                                                                                                                 | 345803 |
| ​If you use the component wizard to create a new rendering, it creates a data source item but does not link it to the new rendering.                                                                                                                      | 326489 |
| The `Dropdown` filter component for SXA search ignores the scope defined in the URL when providing the search results.                                                                                                                                   | 337994 |
| The `Rich Text Editor` profile is different in the Content Editor and in the Experience Editor.                                                                                                                                                          | 358258 |
| If the current user has no access to the Home item, the `sitemap.xml` is inaccessible.                                                                                                                                                                   | 354111 |
| In the `Splitter` component, if you remove and re-add a snippet, it causes unintended layout output.                                                                                                                                                     | 338253 |
| In components that were created with the Component Wizard, the rendering view tries to render variant fields even when the component variants are disabled.                                                                                              | 338269 |
| The same site is resolved differently when you open it in Experience Editor before and after you install SXA.                                                                                                                                            | 380953 |
| In the Experience Editor, the `Select Media` dialog does not show the language version's display name of media items in the content tree.                                                                                                                | 397386 |
| Global item bucket settings do not work in SXA headless sites.                                                                                                                                                                                           | 421007 |
| If you remove and re-add a snippet in the Splitter component, it results in an unintended layout output.                                                                                                                                                 | 338253 |
| If a data template is missing for any item under `/sitecore/layout`, the SXA Toolbox is not displayed.                                                                                                                                                   | 411659 |
| In the Experience Editor, if you collapse the ribbon during a drag & drop operation, the drop target (blue triangle) is hidden.                                                                                                                          | 427672 |
| Links from the wrong SXA sites are generated in EXM emails.                                                                                                                                                                                              | 430959 |
| The draggable area in SXA is always limited by the initial window size.                                                                                                                                                                                  | 433768 |
| Personalization doesn't work for composite components that use local data sources.                                                                                                                                                                       | 450108 |
