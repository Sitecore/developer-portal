Sitecore for Visual Studio gives development teams access to the convenience of GUI tools for developing websites using Sitecore 10’s new developer experience. By using a remote rendering host, developers can build straight from Visual Studio into the rendering host and test changes without needing to recycle Sitecore every time.

Make quick changes to the presentation layer, push those changes, and debug in a fraction of the time.
