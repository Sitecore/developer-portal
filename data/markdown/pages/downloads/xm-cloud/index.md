## XM to XM Cloud Migration tool

This tool helps move content, media and user data from a source Sitecore Experience Manager (XM) instance to a target XM Cloud environment.
It is middleware that simplifies the task of entering and selecting data, and orchestrating the migration.
The tool is available in both a self-contained Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool, and a Command Line Interface (CLI) comprising operations that you can embed into your own tooling.

**Version 2 is based on XM Cloud's Item Transfer technology:**
- Delivers fast data transfers built on Google's Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) format.
- Supports migrations from Sitecore XM on-premises and PaaS versions 9.1 and later.
<br/>

**Enhancements over version 1 include:**
- Migration dependencies delivered via a Sitecore package.
- Dependencies contained within a single folder for easier isolation.
- Self-contained executables with no required prerequisites.
- No longer depends on Sitecore CLI, Sitecore Content Serialization (SCS), Sitecore Managed Services (SMS).
- Enhanced console usage by incorporating sub-commands.
