## Improvements

| Description | Ref. |
| --- | --- |
| Updated the Microsoft .NET Core dependency, from .NET 6 to .NET 8. | 613902 |
| The .NET 8 compatibility also required updating the Duende IdentityServer dependency, from Duende IdentityServer 6.0.4 to 7.0.8. | 624508 |
| For Azure App Service deployments, starting with Identity Server 8.0 a new ARM Template dedicated to the Identity Server module is provided. | 624942 |
| For containerized deployments, starting with Identity Server 8.0 the name of container image has been changed from, for example *sitecore-id7* to *sitecore-identity*. Its tag is now aligned with the version of the Sitecore Identity Server itself, for example *sxp/sitecore-identity:8.0-ltsc2022*. |
| Replaced Azure Application Insights - Instrumentation Key Ingestion with Connection Strings, in response to Microsoft declaring end of support for Instrumentation Key Ingestion as of March 31, 2025. For more information see [KB1003554: Application Insights â€“ end of support for Instrumentation Key Ingestion](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1003554)| 621268 |
| Added a new license key for the dependent Duende software. This new new license key is valid until November 18, 2027. An expired license key will not impact Sitecore Identity Server functionality, but will display a warning message. For more information see [KB1003162: Sitecore Identity Server license key expiration](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1003162). | 624800 |

## Breaking Changes

| Description | Ref. |
| --- | --- |
| For Identity Server on-premises and containerized deployments, Microsoft .NET 8 enforces higher security in the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, enabling encryption by default for network traffic with SQL Server. For more information see the applicable install or uprade guide. For Azure App Service deployments, encryption was already enabled previous Identity Server versions. | 613902 |
