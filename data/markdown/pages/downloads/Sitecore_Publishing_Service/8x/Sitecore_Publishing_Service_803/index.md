The Sitecore Publishing Service is an opt-in service providing an alternative to the default Sitecore publishing mechanism focusing on increased performance by doing operations in bulk. It uses a different approach than the default publishing mechanism and is not a like for like replacement. There are differences to UI, integration points, deployment and in some cases publishing behavior.

Integrating this service into Sitecore Experience Platform also requires the Sitecore Publishing Services Module.\
See [Sitecore Publishing Service – compatibility tables](<https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0761308>) for compatibility between versions of Sitecore Publishing Service, Sitecore Publishing Service Module, and Sitecore Experience Platform.

See [all available Sitecore Publishing Service versions here](/downloads/Sitecore_Publishing_Service).\
See [all available Module versions here](/downloads/Sitecore_Publishing_Service_Module).
