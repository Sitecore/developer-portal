Sitecore® Experience Platform™ 9.2 begins the integrated experience between ContentHub and Sitecore XP. Starting with integration with ContentHub’s Content Marketing Platform and the Digital Asset Management this is the first step in Sitecore’s integration delivering complete ownership of the content lifecycle.

Other highlights include:

- Enhancements to JSS & SXA: Two significant functional updates to Sitecore’s JavaScript Services and Sitecore Experience Accelerator frameworks. JSS now fully supports Sitecore Forms enabling efficient form creation coupled with headless deployments. Multi-site management capabilities, originally found in SXA, is now also found with JSS solutions. JSS users can control and share content or presentation in a headless marketing environment.
- Active Personalization Dashboard: A new optimization feature providing holistic insight into all active personalization tactics within your solution. This new dashboard will provide an overview of all personalization actively occurring. Along with reach and effect metrics, marketing teams can quickly see poorly performing or well performing tactics to act upon them.
- Data Purging API: A new API call to control and actively pursue data purging and archiving strategies. This API gives companies complete control over their solution’s data. Purge unnecessary data for a lower cost of ownership and to meet any privacy requirements.

This release is issued after extensive testing and feedback from customers, partners and developers, resulting in a new level of quality across the product and documentation. For developer documentation please refer to documentation website.
