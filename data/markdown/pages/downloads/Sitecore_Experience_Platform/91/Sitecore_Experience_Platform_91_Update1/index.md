Sitecore® 9.1 delivers omnichannel marketing at scale, natively integrated data insights, and enhanced behavioral tracking capabilities. Additional enhancements include Federated Authentication, WCAG 2.0 compliance in SXA, external triggers for Data Exchange Framework 2.1, as well as performance improvements for deployments. Please refer to release notes for all innovations and enhancements in Sitecore® 9.1.

Major highlights include:

• Sitecore Cortex™ combines advanced machine learning algorithms and a processing engine enabling rapid implementation of ML/AI–based technology by any product/customer on experience data in the xDB. In Sitecore® 9.1, Sitecore Cortex™ offers content tagging to improve SEO results and ROI, and suggested recommendations to take the guesswork out of testing and optimization. Cortex is also a completely plugin architecture supporting “Bring Your Own ML” meaning teams can integrate their own algorithms or machine learning workers they need.

• Sitecore Omni™ expands on Sitecore’s headless capabilities to deliver ‘no compromise headless’ – meaning marketers obtain all the benefits of the Sitecore Experience Platform™ in a decoupled deployment scenario. Omni comes with an SDK for JavaScript developers to build fully-fledged customer experience using Sitecore and the JS UI library. From authoring capabilities such as templating and workflow to marketing capabilities such as personalization, optimization and analytics, heedlessly delivered but managed from one connected platform.

• The Universal Tracker - Mobile analytics for a connected customer experience. In 9.1, this is an API first, a micro-service-based tracking service to track actions from new channels. The universal tracker will track interactions in real time on any application, such as a mobile app, whether the device is online or offline.

This release is issued after extensive testing and feedback from customers, partners and developers, resulting in a new level of quality across the product and documentation. For developer documentation please refer to documentation website.
