SitecoreAI includes a rich offering of developer tools for setting up including apps to manage deployments, integration frameworks and SDKs for development. Developers can continue following the same patterns, with additional capabilities have been provided to building great things on SitecoreAI.

## Content SDK
The Sitecore Content SDK is a toolkit for building scalable, personalized digital experiences with XM Cloud. It streamlines development using modern frameworks like Next.js, offering unified APIs for layout, content, and tracking, all designed to accelerate delivery and simplify workflows.

## Marketplace SDK
The open-source Marketplace SDK enables developers to build JavaScript or TypeScript applications for the Sitecore Marketplace, extending and customising Sitecore products with new capabilities. Two main functions: 
- App-to-SitecoreAI interactions: The required client package securely connects your app to SitecoreAI, allowing it to appear in and interact with SitecoreAI extension points.
- API access to SitecoreAI: Optional packages provide type-safe interfaces for accessing Sitecore product APIs, supporting both client-side and server-side operations as needed.

## Agent SDK
The Agent API introduces a higher-level, business-oriented way to interact with Sitecore. Instead of stitching together multiple low-level endpoints, you can now use intuitive commands to achieve complex outcomes in a single call.

It’s built with interoperability at its core, making it simple to connect Sitecore to any AI client or enterprise system. You can build agentic workflows, intelligent automations, or integrations that respond to user intent and trigger Sitecore actions directly.

For example, Gradial uses the Agent API to turn marketing requests into real outputs. A ticket in Jira or Asana can trigger Sitecore to generate a campaign page, update content, or localize assets based on a simple input.

You can build similar workflows, connecting your own tools and AI assistants to Sitecore to drive intelligent automation and accelerate time to market.

## Marketplace MCP
Marketer MCP connects Sitecore directly with leading AI platforms like Claude and Cursor, enabling you to turn natural language prompts into real, executable marketing actions.

Built on the open Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard, Marketer MCP allows AI assistants to understand Sitecore’s capabilities and can trigger actions securely. Marketers can simply describe what they need, and the Marketer MCP translates those requests into the appropriate actions in Sitecore.

### Example use cases

- **AI-to-action campaign execution**
Work directly in your preferred AI assistant. With a simple prompt like "Launch a new landing page for our fall campaign", Marketer MCP interprets the request and executes it in Sitecore—creating the page, generating or updating content, and organizing assets automatically. This reduces handoffs, eliminates tool switching, and accelerates campaign delivery.

- **End-to-end workflow orchestration**
Coordinate Sitecore with other MCP-enabled tools, such as Asana, Figma, or analytics platforms using a prompt like "Pull new tasks from Asana and publish the approved campaign page in Sitecore.” Because Marketer MCP follows an open standard, you can unify actions across systems, using AI as the control hub for your marketing stack. This creates streamlined workflows, less friction, and consistent execution across channels and tools.
