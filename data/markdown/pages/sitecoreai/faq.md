## Launch & Transition
<details>
<summary><strong>What happened to XM Cloud?</strong></summary>
<p>XM Cloud will be the core platform, with entry-level access to CDP & Personalize, Search, and Content Hub. All Sitecore-built AI use cases are included at no extra cost to you.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>When is SitecoreAI launching?</strong></summary>
  <p>The global launch of SitecoreAI takes place on November 10, 2025. All XM Cloud customers will be upgraded automatically. The full unification of all shared services, including orchestration and data layers, will progress following this update.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>What exactly is SitecoreAI? How is it different from what I already have?</strong></summary>
  <p>SitecoreAI is Sitecore’s next-generation marketing platform that unites everything needed to create, manage, and optimize digital experiences. It brings content, data, personalization, and AI automation into one connected system. Instead of switching between separate tools, marketers can work faster and focus on strategy while the platform handles the busywork. </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you need to replatform to use SitecoreAI?</strong></summary>
  <p>No. XM Cloud customers do not need to replatform to use SitecoreAI. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, allowing you to use its AI capabilities without a full migration. This means you can enhance your current digital experience with advanced personalization, search, and content management features that drive better business outcomes. Both new and existing customers are provisioned with SitecoreAI based on their current setup. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What happens to my Content Hub?</strong></summary>
  <p>Content Hub is part of the overall SitecoreAI package and is included in the entitlements purchased by you. For now, it will continue to operate as a separate application that can be provisioned on request; it is not automatically provisioned. </p>
</details>


## Platform features and capabilities
<details>
  <summary><strong>How can I navigate between different capabilities like CDP, PErsonalize, Search and Content Hub within SitecoreAI.</strong></summary>
  <p>The SitecoreAI navigation brings all core capabilities together in one interface, making it easy for users to move between content, personalization, and AI features without switching applications. The navigation is [documented here](/sitecoreai/navigation).</p>
  <p>From the SitecoreAI navigation, users can directly access key capabilities such as CDP, Personalize, and Search. Content Hub remains a separate application that can be accessed through the Sitecore Cloud Portal and will be integrated more closely with SitecoreAI in future releases.  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is Sitecore Studio, and how does it make the platform open?</strong></summary>
      <p>Sitecore Studio brings the customization and extensibility Sitecore is known for—now reimagined for an AI-native, SaaS environment. It empowers organizations to adapt faster, innovate at scale, and continuously extend SitecoreAI’s capabilities to fit their evolving digital ambitions. </p>
  <p>Sitecore Studio brings together four key components:</p>
  
  <ul>
      <li>App studio – build and configure custom or public apps, extensions, and AI agents using Sitecore’s APIs, SDKs, and marketer MCP. </li>
    <li>Agentic studio – design and manage AI agents that plan, personalize, and optimize campaigns. </li>
    <li>Marketplace – discover, install, and publish apps and AI agents (coming soon). </li>
    <li>Sitecore Connect – integrate with third-party systems through prebuilt connectors and recipes or create your own. </li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is Agentic Studio?</strong></summary>
  <p>Agentic Studio is the workspace inside SitecoreAI where marketers can use, customize, and manage AI agents. It provides a no-code, drag-and-drop environment where users can build their own agents without needing technical expertise.</p>
  <p>Within Agentic Studio, marketers can use the chat interface called Actions to get tasks done quickly, choose from prebuilt agents for common workflows, or build their own agents to fit specific processes. Agents can work independently or together, helping teams move faster while maintaining brand governance and human oversight. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Does SitecoreAI share or train external AI models using my data?</strong></summary>
  <p>SitecoreAI does not share customer data with external providers or use it to train external AI models. All data interactions stay within your own environment, under your organization’s governance and control.</p>
