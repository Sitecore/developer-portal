## Launch & Transition
<details>
<summary><strong>What happened to XM Cloud?</strong></summary>
<p>XM Cloud will be the core platform, with entry-level access to CDP & Personalize, Search, and Content Hub. All Sitecore-built AI use cases are included at no extra cost to you.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>When is SitecoreAI launching?</strong></summary>
  <p>The global launch of SitecoreAI takes place on November 10, 2025. All XM Cloud customers will be upgraded automatically. The full unification of all shared services, including orchestration and data layers, will progress following this update.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>What exactly is SitecoreAI? How is it different from what I already have?</strong></summary>
  <p>SitecoreAI is Sitecore’s next-generation marketing platform that unites everything needed to create, manage, and optimize digital experiences. It brings content, data, personalization, and AI automation into one connected system. Instead of switching between separate tools, marketers can work faster and focus on strategy while the platform handles the busywork. </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><strong>Do you need to replatform to use SitecoreAI?</strong></summary>
  <p>No. XM Cloud customers do not need to replatform to use SitecoreAI. The platform is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing systems, allowing you to use its AI capabilities without a full migration. This means you can enhance your current digital experience with advanced personalization, search, and content management features that drive better business outcomes. Both new and existing customers are provisioned with SitecoreAI based on their current setup. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What happens to my Content Hub?</strong></summary>
  <p>Content Hub is part of the overall SitecoreAI package and is included in the entitlements purchased by you. For now, it will continue to operate as a separate application that can be provisioned on request; it is not automatically provisioned. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What if I do not have XM Cloud?</strong></summary>
  <p>Speak to your Account team for further details on how you can transition from your current product to SitecoreAI. </p>

## Platform features and capabilities

<details>
  <summary><strong>Where are my XM Cloud tools and features?</strong></summary>
