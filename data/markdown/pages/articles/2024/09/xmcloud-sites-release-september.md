A Site Collections will group your sites and make these more accessible. It allows for much more focused working on the content by streamlining the work towards the key areas of the particular marketer. This can be achieved by the existing Security model.

Marking your site as shared enables you to share content and configuration between sites within one site collection. Content from shared sites can be used in other sites. That helps managing centralized content like global campaigns even more.

Also, your presentation related items like page and partial designs, Available Renderings, Styles and Rendering Variants are shared. That helps to centrally administer your sites.
