## Introduction

### XP2XMP - General

**What is XP2XMP?**

XP2XMP stands for &quot;Experience Platform to Experience Manager with Personalize&quot;.

Experience Manager (XM) + Personalize is intended to be an Experience Platform (XP) replacement solution. The XM + Personalize product bundle includes:

- Sitecore Experience Manager (XM) for content management
- Sitecore Personalize for personalization &amp; testing

XM + Personalize is the go-to content and personalization solution for delivering fast, relevant and standout website and omnichannel experiences â€“ providing modern technology to support customer digital transformation and maturity.

XM can be hosted in the customer&#39;s Cloud or through Sitecore Managed Cloud. Sitecore Personalize is delivered as SaaS.

**What are the benefits of buying a bundle of products versus buying what I need individually (the main benefit behind composable)?**

Specifically, for XP2XMP, the benefit of the bundle is the commercial incentive versus buying XM &amp; Personalize separately outside of the sales play. The special deal is valid through 30 June 2022 only.
