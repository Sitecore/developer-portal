## What's going to be the pricing point for XM Cloud?

Please work with your Sales team on specific pricing questions.

## Is the embedded personalization in Pages included in the cost of XM Cloud, or an extra add-on?

XM Cloud will be bundled with both Pages and embedded personalization, so there are no extra costs for either.

## Can Pages be licensed without XM Cloud (for example, have a third-party CMS, buy Sitecore CDP and Pages)

At the moment, Pages is only available as part of the XM Cloud solution.

## Does Experience Edge come bundled with the XM Cloud subscription?

XM Cloud is bundled with Pages, Headless Services, and Experience Edge together in a single subscription. There is no need to purchase separate modules for these features.
