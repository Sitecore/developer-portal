## Will the Content Hub ONE product be aware of Pages and enable page organization, hierarchy, and metadata/ page specific information?

Content Hub ONE is a pure headless CMS and, unlike XM Cloud, it will not have any awareness of sites, pages, or layout. It will be dedicated to managing structured content and assets only.

## What about Horizon?

Horizon is the on-premise web page editor that will not be upgraded beyond XM 10.2 version. Pages is the next-gen editor delivered as a SaaS through the XM Cloud solution. Customers will no longer run a local version of Horizon. Pages is a multi-tenant service that is available to XM Cloud users.
