### Can I extend XM + Personalize websites using my existing .NET MVC component library?

MVC websites that are self-hosted or run in Sitecore Managed Cloud with the XM + Personalize product bundle should continue to support existing .NET MVC components.

### We use Sitecore XM's content search API and have customized the indexes. Will this work in XM + Personalize and also in XM Cloud?

Customers will be able to create custom indexes if they host Sitecore Experience Manager (XM) in their own Cloud or use Sitecore Managed Cloud.

With XM Cloud, customers will not be able to create custom indexes as Solr will be fully controlled by the XM Cloud platform. Sitecore recommends that customers use a third-party search provider if custom indexes are required.

### What extension possibilities/flexibility for custom business requirements are there for XM and Personalize?

Sitecore Experience Manager (XM) and Personalize offer comprehensive configuration options for marketers, and extensive APIs for developers, enabling customers to meet their specific business requirements. The configuration and customization options for the products exceed what can be covered within this FAQ. Please contact Sitecore for further details.
