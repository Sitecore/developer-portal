## Context

Localization refers to the set of features and overall process of making an application accessible and consumable to a region or language. Localization needs to be thought of in distinct features, that may be applied together or separately to achieve the desired localization solution including:

<ul>
<li>Localized URLs including language code slugs, localized URLs & page names and multi-domain routing</li>
<li>Language fallback</li>
<li>Dictionary phrases</li>
</ul>
