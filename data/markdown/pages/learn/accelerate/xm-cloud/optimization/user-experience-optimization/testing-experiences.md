## Context
You want to maximize user experience and conversions but don't know what version of a page or component performs best. [A/B/n testing](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/a-b-n-testing.html) allows you to make decisions based on user behavior instead of internal speculation. This is particularly helpful post-launch, during optimization sprints, or in preparation for rollouts across many sites or geographies.

> To use A/B/n testing, you need to make sure you are on JSS 22.1 or later and the [features enabled](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/jss/22/jss-xmc/page-personalization-and-component-a-b-n-testing.html).

## Execution
A/B/n testing is used to compare different versions of a pages components or content such as a call-to-action buttons, to see which one drives more click through rates. This helps create a more dynamic and effective user experience, ultimately boosting satisfaction and overall business outcomes.

### Strategy Planning
Leveraging XM Cloud's A/B/n testing provides data-driven insights that refine and improve marketing efforts. This approach creates continuous improvement, boosts ROI, and strengthens customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.

When planning A/B/n testing there are important stages to consider when building your testing strategy.

#### 1. Business objectives alignment
Planning and building a strategy is important for effective A/B/n testing in Sitecore XM Cloud, as they ensure that tests are purposeful, focused, and aligned with the business objectives. A well-thought-out strategy helps define clear goals for the testing process, such as user engagement or content relevance. By carefully selecting the components/content to test, creating hypotheses and determining success metrics in advance, a business can avoid wasting time and resources on ineffective experiments.

Additionally, planning helps prioritize tests based on their potential impact, ensuring that you focus on high-value testing first. With XM Cloud’s testing capabilities, a thought out approach leverages the platform’s insights to make informed decisions, iteratively improving the user experience and driving better outcomes over time.

#### 2. Test-and-learn cycle
Using a test-and-learn cycle for A/B/n testing in XM Cloud is an important stage for continuously improving user experiences and optimizing site performance. By running tests, you can try different variations of content, design, or imagery and directly measure their impact on performance goals. The iterative nature of the test-and-learn approach enables a business to gather valuable insights over time, helping to understand what resonates best with their audience and which strategies lead to the desired outcomes.

This continuous learning process allows for data-driven decisions, reducing guesswork and ensuring that each test results is backed by real user behavior. Ultimately, the test-and-learn cycle empowers businesses to refine their digital presence in real-time, ensuring a dynamic experience that adapts to user preferences as time goes on.

### Steps to XM Cloud A/B/n Testing

Review the [Get started with A/B/n testing](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/get-started-with-a-b-n-testing.html) for steps to walk through setting up A/B/n testing in XM Cloud.

When brainstorming A/B/n tests for your XM Cloud site, considering a few specific points are important to ensure your tests are effective and meaningful.
-  Identify what you want to achieve with your A/B tests - this could be increasing conversion rates, reducing bounce rates, or improving user engagement.
- Focus on areas of your website that have the most significant impact on your goals - this could be key landing pages, checkout processes, or call-to-action buttons.
- Develop clear, testable hypotheses based on your goals and audience insights. For example, "Changing the colour of the CTA button will increase click-through rates".

Set up your test by configuring options such as the goal of your test, assigning traffic to variants, setting automated actions based on the test outcome, and editing advanced options like the percentage of visitor traffic to include in the test. The goal options for A/B/n testing iinvolve configuring a test goal that reflects what you aim to achieve and should always be considered from the beginning of a test. The metrics of this goal are used to calculate the required number of visits to declare a variant as the winner or to declare the test inconclusive.

After running your tests, analyze the results to see if your [hypothesis](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/a-b-n-test-hypothesis-and-goal.html) was correct. Use these insights to make informed decisions, apply changes such as setting up personalization and plan future tests. Keep detailed records of your tests, including hypotheses, variations, results, and learnings. This documentation can help refine your testing strategy over time

Review the [Best practices for A/B/n testing](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/best-practices-for-a-b-n-testing.html) documentation for further guidlines.

## Insights

When using A/B/n testing, there's are some key considerations to keep in mind:

| Consideration | Detail |
| - | - |
| **Data-Driven decisions**|A/B/n testing relies on data to compare different versions of a webpage to see which performs better.|
| **Hypothesis-Driven testing**|A/B/n testing should be hypothesis-driven. Clearly define what you are testing and what you expect to achieve with goals in mind from the beginning. This helps in measuring the success of your tests accurately.|
| **Clear Goals and KPIs**|Define clear goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) for A/B/n testing to ensure that you can measure success and make informed decisions when reviewing and planning for future ideas.|
| **Test one variable at a time**|In A/B/n testing, focus on testing one variable at a time to isolate its impact. This helps in understanding which specific change led to the observed results.
| **Iterative approach**|A/B/n testing should be iterative with continuously analyse results, learning from them, and refine your strategies to improve user experience and achieve better outcomes.|
