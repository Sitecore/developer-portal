## Context
To ensure your first XM Cloud website performs reliably, securely, and meets the business and user requirement, a testing strategy needs to be in place before, during, and after go-live.

## Execution
Start scope the test plan early, during the Discovery and Project Setup phases - preferably as requirements are being collected, the delivery plan is being outlined, and roles and environments are being mapped. 

By this point, clear testing goals must be defined: what specifically must be validated - functionality, user experience, performance, security? Consider the potential business risks of insufficient testing, and if there are any regulatory or accessibility standards that must be met. Addressing these questions up-front offers a sound foundation for a successful, risk-minimized deployment.

### Roles & Ownership
Just as important is defining ownership - clearly assign who is responsible for planning, executing, and validating each stage of testing to avoid gaps and ensure accountability.

| **Role** | **Key Testing Responsibilities** |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Product Owner** | <ul><li>Define testing objectives based on business goals and acceptance criteria</li><li>Identify critical business risks</li><li>Approve UAT scope and outcomes</li><li>Ensure accessibility and compliance standards are considered</li></ul> |

| **End User / Business Stakeholder** | <ul><li>Participate in UAT to validate usability and business outcomes including authoring process</li><li>Provide feedback on workflows, navigation, and user experience</li><li>Confirm the solution meets business expectations before go-live</li><li>Identify gaps or issues from a real-world usage perspective</li></ul> |


### Testing Plan
A testing plan should be setup based on the implementation requirements that outlines the key environments, testing layers, tools, and approaches required to confidently deliver and support the implementation. This not only should align all stakeholders involves but also ensure the project runs on track.

The plan should support both manual and automated testing practices but needs to include:

| **Area** | **Detail** |
|----------|------------|
| **Environment** | Testing flows through clearly defined environments:<ul><li><strong>Development:</strong> for developer testing and unit validation</li><li><strong>UAT:</strong> for QA-led functional, regression, and integration testing, as well as stakeholder-led UAT</li><li><strong>Production:</strong> for go-live readiness and final smoke testing</li></ul> |
| **Testing Layers** | <ul><li><strong>Developer Testing:</strong> Unit tests, local validation, schema validation</li><li><strong>QA Testing:</strong> Functional, regression, accessibility, integration</li><li><strong>Component:</strong> Individual rendering/component behaviour</li><li><strong>Page:</strong> Template layout, content variants, metadata</li><li><strong>API:</strong> Headless data responses, GraphQL or REST endpoints</li><li><strong>Integration:</strong> Third-party systems, personalization APIs, middleware</li><li><strong>System:</strong> Combined flows, including authentication, search, and editing</li><li><strong>User:</strong> Authoring & marketer workflows, end-user navigation</li></ul> |
| **Tools** | Tools used across the project including:<ul><li><strong>QA Tools:</strong> Selenium (for automation)</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Lighthouse</li><li><strong>API Testing:</strong> Postman, Swagger</li><li><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> Rendering Host Analytics, Lighthouse</li><li><strong>Content Validation:</strong> Browser testing tools, real devices vs emulators</li><li><strong>Bug Tracking:</strong> Jira</li></ul> |
| **Automation Focus** | <ul><li><strong>Regression:</strong> Automated tests for reusable components and critical paths (e.g., homepage load, navigation, form submission)</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Run checks against WCAG standards</li><li><strong>Smoke Tests:</strong> Verify deploy success across environments (e.g. build, routing)</li></ul> |
| **Manual Testing** | <ul><li><strong>Developer Testing:</strong> Run and validate unit tests locally</li><li><strong>QA Testing:</strong> Execute planned test cases and exploratory sessions to uncover edge cases, unexpected behaviours</li><li><strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT):</strong> Business stakeholder walkthroughs with defined scripts</li><li><strong>Design Review:</strong> Alignment with designs or style guide</li><li><strong>Personalization Validation:</strong> Confirm rules work across visitor groups, SSR/SSG responses render the right content</li></ul> |

### Testing Types & Timelines
The table below outlines the key types of testing involved in an XM Cloud implementation, along with typical timelines, purposes, and responsible roles. Each type serves a distinct purpose, from validating individual components to verifying business acceptance and accessibility compliance.

## Insights
It's very important to keep testing hygiene in place to have content stability and quality during testing: utilize dedicated environments to stage and verify content, and don't push placeholder or test content to production.

Authoring scenarios must mimic real-life use cases, such as multilingual, personalized, and component-based layouts, to validate appropriately.

Insert automated build verification tests into each deployment to identify significant problems early and retain confidence in the experience shipped.

Lastly, introduce a QA gate before deploying to production. This verifies that content and presentation have been checked, minimizing the possibility of regressions, broken layouts, or incorrectly configured experiences making it to end users.

### Testing Checklist
As any other process, documentation is key to any project - a testing checklist should be maintained, with the essential artefacts, to ensure confidence throughout. 



| **Phase**       | **Key Tests** |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Build**       | <ul><li>Unit tests for individual functions and components</li><li>Integration testing between modules and APIs</li><li>Component-level accessibility checks (e.g., using Lighthouse during development)</li></ul> |
| **QA / UAT**    | <ul><li>System testing across full workflows and backend processes</li><li>Regression testing to confirm no breakages</li><li>Performance testing under typical and peak load conditions</li><li>Security testing for APIs, auth flows, and endpoint protection</li><li>Content validation: structure, metadata, variants, and authoring experience</li></ul> |
| **Pre Go-Live** | <ul><li>UAT sign-off from business stakeholders</li><li>Personalization validation across visitor groups and rendering paths</li><li>Final smoke test in production-ready environment</li><li>Lighthouse scans to ensure performance, SEO, accessibility, and best practices are met</li></ul> |
| **Post Go-Live**| <ul><li>Monitor key tags, scripts, and trackers for correct firing</li><li>Review analytics dashboards for anomalies and drop-offs</li><li>Log and triage issues surfaced by users or business teams</li><li>Establish a feedback loop with content authors and end users to capture improvements or defects early</li></ul> |

Testing artefacts provide the documentation, structure, and traceability needed to manage quality, and allow you to get sign off in a consistent and accountable way.
