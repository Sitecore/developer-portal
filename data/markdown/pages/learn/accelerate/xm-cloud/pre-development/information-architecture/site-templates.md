## Problem

I need to create multiple sites in XM Cloud that have basic content and presentation including some pre-designed pages.

## Solution

New sites can be created directly from the XM Cloud dashboard using site templates reusing previously created modules along with your features and components. An overview of the steps can be see below:

- Build a site template
- Build or reuse modules for the site setup
- Build installation descriptions of common content architecture
- Create a new site from site template in XM Cloud Sites
- Select language you want to apply as default

Detailed [documentation](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/create-a-site-template-for-the-xm-cloud-dashboard.html) is available on how to configure site templates. This documentation walks you through how to copy and customize some of the existing items already available for the basic site setup. Providing you with a good foundation for further customization and more efficient roll out multiple sites.
