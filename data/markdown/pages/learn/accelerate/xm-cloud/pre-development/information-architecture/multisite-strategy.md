## Context
Multi-brand and global businesses tend to battle to scale digital experiences - teams launch sites with ill-defined scope, alignment, and operations ownership resulting in variable quality, duplicate work, and disappointing ROI. XM Cloud provides flexibility and scale to extend beyond these limitations, but only when combined with a properly organized digital factory model that fits your business.


## Execution
Multi-brand and global organizations frequently struggle to scale site launches without a shared foundation, clear operational ownership, or governance structures. Teams quickly default to siloed efforts which result in fragmented experiences.

To avoid replicating past inefficiencies, you must look at establish a digital factory mindset that emphasizes shared foundations, reusable architecture with an ownership that reflects your organization setup.

### Factory Models
A website factory model provides a framework for efficiently launching and managing multiple sites. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, but choosing a model needs to consider your org’s size, complexity, and localization needs.

Below are common models, each with distinct governance, ownership, and operational characteristics. Most organizations evolve from one to another as digital maturity increases.

#### 1. Digital Factory
This is the most balanced and scalable model, blending efficiency with flexibility. A global team defines the technical and design foundation, while regional or business units execute content and experience delivery.

| Category             | Details                                                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Characteristics** | <ul><li>Shared master templates, components, and reference applications</li><li>Site masters per brand, division, or country provide standardization with built-in flexibility</li><li>Local teams operate within clearly defined governance boundaries</li></ul> |
| **Benefits**          | <ul><li>Rapid site launches using pre-approved assets</li><li>Brand consistency with local market customization</li><li>Clear separation between platform stewardship and content ownership</li></ul> |
| **Ideal For**         | <ul><li>Organizations with multiple brands or regions needing both central efficiency and local agility</li></ul> |

#### 2. Website Factory Model
This model operates like a managed service: a central team owns the platform, builds the sites, and delivers them as packaged services to internal stakeholders. Local teams typically manage content only, or request changes via formal channels.

| Category             | Details                                                                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Characteristics** | <ul><li>Central team delivers sites end-to-end</li><li>Platform, design systems, and workflows are shared and reused</li><li>Site launches are standardized, invoiced, and often SLA-driven</li></ul> |
| **Benefits**          | <ul><li>Strong control over quality, cost, and compliance</li><li>High reuse of assets and infrastructure</li><li>Lower operational overhead for business units</li></ul> |
| **Ideal For**         | <ul><li>Brands with centralized marketing or where localization is minimal or tightly governed</li></ul> |

#### 3. Localized Model
This model supports a global brand presence with regional autonomy. A core global site communicates the brand vision, while regional teams manage their own sites—often with different teams, priorities, and tools.

| Category     | Details                                                                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure** | <ul><li>Global site focuses on brand storytelling, corporate content, and shared campaigns</li><li>Regional sites managed independently, potentially on their own infrastructure or content models</li><li>Varying levels of alignment on design, tech stack, and KPIs</li></ul> |
| **Best For**  | <ul><li>Companies where regional market needs vary significantly</li><li>Organizations in early transformation phases that are still federated in digital operations</li></ul> |
| **Risks**     | <ul><li>Fragmented tech stacks, duplicated effort, and inconsistent brand execution</li><li>Difficult to maintain shared analytics, personalization, or experimentation</li></ul> |

#### 4. Decentralized Brand Ops
Designed for companies managing multiple sub-brands or business units that need independent creative direction but benefit from centralized support. This functions like an internal service bureau with built-in innovation and enablement.

| Category     | Details                                                                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure** | <ul><li>Centralized templates per division</li><li>Shared support for performance, personalization, experimentation</li><li>Internal chargeback or service model to manage requests</li></ul> |
| **Best For**  | <ul><li>Enterprises with strong sub-brands, innovation mandates, or internal complexity</li><li>Teams that need tailored experiences and frequent experimentation</li></ul> |
| **Risks**     | <ul><li>Fragmented tech stacks, duplicated effort, and inconsistent brand execution</li><li>Difficult to maintain shared analytics, personalization, or experimentation</li><li>Central team becomes a bottleneck if service model is not resourced properly</li><li>Brand teams may experiment without performance guardrails or centralized learnings</li></ul> |

### Setting up for success
Based on your business setup, you will have consider the right foundation for you based on these models.

#### 1. Start with a clear, reusable foundation

Your first implementation isn’t just a launch, it’s the model for everything that follows. Establish strong architectural and governance principles up front.
- Clearly define what will be delivered now and what’s intentionally deferred. Avoid bloated launches - your first site is the blueprint, not a one-off.
- Invest in [reusable templates](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/building-page-templates.html), [components](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/adding-content-to-a-page.html), and consistent tagging strategies.
- Define scope gates, shared terminology, and escalation paths early to manage future scale and requests effectively. Review [Scope and Goverance Framework](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/pre-development/discovery/scope-governance-framework) recipe for additional detail.

#### 2. Define operational ownership
Multisite success hinges on cross-functional coordination. Establish clear roles, accountability mechanisms, and processes for stability and change.
- Align expectations across business, marketing, IT, and partners: from delivery timelines to scope boundaries.
- Set up weekly syncs and milestone reviews to manage interdependencies and reduce rework.
- Define deployment ownership, escalation procedures, observability standards, rollback protocols, and release checklists such as [Go-Live checklist](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/final-steps/go-live-checklist).

Review [Testing Framework](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/final-steps/testing-framework) and [Operational Governance](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/optimization/operational-governance) recipe for additional detail.

#### 3. Choose the right factory model for your organization
Your delivery model should reflect your structure, maturity, and goals. There’s no “best” model - only the one that aligns with your context including organization setup, size and structure.


| Model                   | Best For                          | Governance                | Reuse   | Local Flexibility |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Website Factory**     | Standardization & efficiency      | Central                    | High    | Low               |
| **Digital Factory**     | Scale with structure              | Central + Local            | High    | Medium–High       |
| **Localized Model**     | Regional autonomy                 | Distributed                | Low     | High              |
| **Decentralized Brand Ops** | Sub-brand autonomy + innovation | Central ops, brand-led UX  | Medium  | High              |

Most organizations mature toward a Digital Factory model as they grow so align governance to your model - flexible where needed, strict where valuable. Treat your ecosystem like a product platform, not a series of projects.


#### 4. Plan for scale
Governance is not bureaucracy, done well, it accelerates delivery and enables autonomy.

- Establish and communicate a clear vision that leadership supports and teams understand.
- Treat your first site as the foundation for future rollouts - codify what works from developer standards (example [naming conventions](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/pre-development/developer-considerations/component-design-best-practices), [Git strategies](/learn/accelerate/xm-cloud/pre-development/developer-considerations/dev-workflow-codespaces) etc) to UX/UI (example design patterns that support scalability) and content roll-out strategy.
- Build as if another team will replicate it, because they will.

## Insights
Once your strategy, foundation, and ownership model are defined, shift from planning to execution by embedding repeatability, ownership, and optimization into your delivery motion. This transition marks the move from one-off projects to a scalable operating model.
