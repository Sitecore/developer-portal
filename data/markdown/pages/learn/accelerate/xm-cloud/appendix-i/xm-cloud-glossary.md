## XM Cloud Glossary of Terms

### Project

A Project is connected to a source code repository. Each Project can have multiple environments. So a typical setup would be to have one source code repository for one Brand or legal entity and then have a DEV environment, QA, Staging or Pre Prod and Production within that project.

### Environment

An Environment is your physical XM Cloud instance. It consists of a Content Management Instance, that provides certain tooling like Pages, Components, User and Roles Management and more. It also provides an internal nodeJS based editing host, thatâ€™s used for rendering your app for WYSIWYG editing in Pages or Experience Editor. Last but not least it comes with a geographically scaled deliver layer, called Edge. This layer provides a GraphQL Endpoint to be used by your public facing applications. Please note that your public facing app needs to be hosted on an external rendering host (e.g. provided by Vercel).

### Site

A site represents one website or one content repository. A site is able to support multiple languages. Sites can be organized in site collections. Each site comes with a certain structure giving access to the pages/routes, media assets, data sources, dictionary items, presentation configuration as well as site related settings.

Sites can share content and presentation configuration across each other within one site collection if enabled.
