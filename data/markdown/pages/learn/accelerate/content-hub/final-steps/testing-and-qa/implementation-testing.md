## Context
Implementation testing is an important step in the Sitecore Content Hub implementation process. It ensures that the platform's configurations, features, and integrations work as intended before progressing further within the project phases. Effective testing minimizes risk and leads to improved user and customer satisfaction.

## Execution
Implementation testing in Sitecore Content Hub focuses on targeted validation of individual system components, including integrations, asset and content workflows, and migrations. It involves systematic checks by the implementation team before broader user involvement. The testing outlined in this chapter should occur prior to the activities suggested within the Quality Assurance portion of the project (for example, User Acceptance Testing (UAT)).  

We recommend that a documented test plan is created prior to performing formal implementation testing. The test plan ideally should include specific cases/steps/scenarios and their intended outcomes.  

### Suggested Testing Areas
Defining testing areas is essential for ensuring a structured, efficient, and reliable validation process—while also ensuring the end-to-end journey has been thoroughly tested. The following is a highlight of these applications:


| Application |  Checklist |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| <strong>Overall Configuration Validation</strong> <br/> Ensure domain model and custom page configurations align to established requirements. | <ul><li>Confirm that all entities and properties are configured and align with requirements.</li><li>Ensure theme and branding is in place, home page is configured.</li><li>Check that pages include all needed operations and components.</li></ul> |
| <strong>Role-Based Permissions Testing</strong> <br/> Validate user access levels to ensure appropriate permissions. | <ul><li>Test role configurations for alignment with organizational requirements.</li><li>Validate permissions for sensitive content and critical actions, such as deletions.</li><li>Test external user or vendor access to ensure compliance with defined restrictions.</li></ul> |
| <strong>Workflow Testing</strong> <br/> Confirm workflows align with user processes and operate as expected. | <ul><li>Map and test content creation, review, and approval workflows.</li><li>Validate role-based permissions and task assignments within workflows.</li><li>Ensure automated tasks trigger correctly; that emails/notifications are sent (where expected).</li></ul> |
| <strong>Content Migration Validation </strong> <br/> Ensure data migration accuracy and completeness. | <ul><li>Validate all assets and metadata have migrated correctly, with no missing or corrupted data.</li><li>Check the accuracy of content categorization and relationships between assets.</li><li>Test functionality, such as previews, downloads, and file integrity.</li><li>Establish protocols to handle inconsistencies or data issues during migration.</li></ul>|
| <strong>Integration Testing</strong> <br/> Verify correct communication between Sitecore Content Hub and external systems. | <ul><li>Validate data synchronization and flow accuracy across systems.</li><li>Test API endpoints for functionality and security.</li><li>Ensure alerts and notifications work as expected.</li></ul> |
| <strong>Performance Testing</strong> <br/> Assess system scalability and responsiveness under expected loads. | <ul><li>Check the performance of any integrations (in- or/and outbound towards 3th party systems).</li><li>Validate simultaneous uploads, downloads, or large content imports/asset ingestion.</li><li>Review performance of any custom scripts.</li></ul> |

## Insights

Testing is a critical phase of Sitecore Content Hub implementation, ensuring that all functionalities work as expected and meet business requirements. A structured testing approach helps identify defects early, improving overall system stability and user experience.

Testing should cover various user roles, including Super Users, Content Editors, and Administrators, ensuring that all aspects of the platform—from asset management to search and user permissions—function correctly.

### Key Testing Areas

This following outlines key testing activities, a structured test plan, and a sample testing template to facilitate consistent validation of the implementation.


| Area |  Activities |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Asset Lifecycle Management | <ul><li>Upload, edit, and publish assets</li><li>Approvals and rejections</li><li>Asset deletion, archiving, and restoration</li><li>Draft asset creation and master file management </li></ul> |
|Metadata Management| <ul><li>Editing metadata in different views (single edit, mass edit, inline edit)</li><li>Taxonomy updates and validation</li><li>Multi-language metadata support</li></ul>|
|Search & Filtering| <ul><li>Free-text search and advanced search</li><li>Faceted search testing</li><li>Saved searches and collections</li></ul>|
|User Permissions & Security| <ul><li>Role-based access control (RBAC)</li><li>Public and restricted asset access</li><li>Sharing and collaboration features</li></ul>|
|Integrations & Performance| <ul><li>API and third-party integrations</li><li>File uploads, downloads, and rendition generation</li><li>System performance under load</li></ul>|

### Sample Test Plan
Testing plans can take various shapes, the below is a structure to start with but customize based on your process and requirements. For each test make sure you track **Pass/Fail**, **Tester**, **Test Date** and place for **Notes** to capture feedback.

| Test ID |  Action |  Page/Area | Expected Result | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| TST-001 | Upload an asset via UI | Create | Asset is uploaded successfully and appears in Content Hub | 
| TST-002 | Edit asset metadata in create area | Create | Metadata changes are saved successfully |  
| TST-003 | Submit an asset for approval (required fields missing) | Create | System prevents submission and displays validation errors | 
| TST-004 | Approve an asset via details page | Review | Asset is moved to the approved state and available for download |
| TST-005 | Find an asset via advanced search | Assets (Search) | Asset is returned in search results | 
| TST-006 | Download a rendition | Asset Details  | Correct file rendition is downloaded |  
| TST-007 | Share an asset via public link | Asset Details  | Public link is generated and accessible |  
| TST-008 | Add an annotation to an asset | Asset Details  | Annotation appears on the asset |
