## Context

Sitecore Content Hub is a powerful platform for orchestrating enterprise-scale content operations but without clear ownership of its configuration, even the most well-intentioned implementation can become fragmented and inefficient. To ensure Content Hub remains performant, secure, and aligned with business needs, it is essential to establish a System Administrator role. This role provides dedicated oversight of the platform’s configuration—from data schema and taxonomy design to integration management and environment governance.



## Execution

The role emphasizes strong cross-functional alignment by working closely with the Data Librarian, content creators, and IT teams to maximize platform capabilities and integrate governance directly into the system. This collaboration ensures that the platform is not only technically sound but also aligned with user needs. Additionally, a clean, intuitive, and high-performing configuration fosters user adoption and trust, enabling users to navigate the system with confidence and clarity.

Unlike other roles, the System Administrator must be singular and accountable. While some responsibilities may be delegated, there must be a single point of ownership to ensure consistency, traceability, and alignment with Sitecore best practices. The System Administrator is the architect of platform integrity, enabling every content workflow, user experience, and integration to function reliably and sustainably.

To implement the System Administrator role effectively, the first step is to define its scope and responsibilities. The Administrator should be positioned as the technical owner of platform configuration, with end-to-end accountability for system health, scalability, and governance.

This includes:
| Responsibility                   | Description                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Schema Governance**       | Design and maintain a clean, scalable schema that avoids duplication and supports efficient content management.            |
| **Taxonomy Management**          | Collaborate with the Data Librarian to define and evolve taxonomies reflecting business logic and user needs.              |
| **Integration Oversight**        | Manage and maintain integrations with external systems such as PIM, CMS, and ERP platforms.                                |
| **Environment Lifecycle Management** | Oversee configuration deployment across dev, QA, and production environments, ensuring consistency and traceability.  |
| **Media Processing Configuration** | Set up and optimise media renditions and processing rules to enhance performance and usability.                          |
| **User & Security Management**   | Define user groups, roles, and permissions to enforce governance and protect sensitive data.                               |
| **Platform Configuration**       | Manage all settings in the Content Hub’s Manage section, including pages, components, and system defaults.                |


To support this, we’ve created [example Terms of Reference: System Administrator](#terms-of-reference-system-administrator) that outline the role in detail, including responsibilities, required skills, and governance boundaries.

Operationally, the System Administrator should establish clear processes for configuration changes (version control, documentation, stakeholder communication), while also monitor system performance and usage patterns to proactively identify opportunities for optimisation.

> It’s essential to communicate the purpose and importance of the System Administrator role across the organisation. This role is not just about technical setup but about content operations through a scalable configuration.

### Rolling out a System Administrator
Introducing a System Administrator in in large, multi-brand or multi-market environments, configuration drift is a real risk—leading to inconsistent schemas, duplicated taxonomies, and inefficient workflows. The System Administrator mitigates this risk by acting as a central steward of configuration, ensuring that Content Hub remains a well-structured, high-performing platform that can scale with the business.

In smaller organisations or simpler Content Hub implementations, it is both possible and often practical for a single individual to fulfil both the System Administrator and Data Librarian roles.

How this works:
- One person handles both platform configuration and content governance.
- Manages schema, taxonomy, integrations, and user permissions.
- Oversees content workflows, metadata standards, and asset approvals.
- Requires a blend of technical aptitude and content governance awareness.

> While this model reduces overhead and simplifies communication, it concentrates responsibility. The individual in this role must be supported with clear documentation, training, and escalation paths—especially as the implementation grows in complexity.

As the organisation scales, these roles should be separated to maintain clarity of focus and ensure both areas receive the attention they require.

## Insights

### Terms of Reference: System Administrator
**Role Type:** Technical  
**Platform Context:** Sitecore Content Hub  
**Primary Focus:** Configuration governance, system health, and scalable architecture


#### 1. Purpose

The System Administrator is the technical steward of Sitecore Content Hub. This role is responsible for configuring and maintaining the platform across all business units and projects, ensuring that the system is performant, scalable, and aligned with Sitecore’s best practice recommendations.

Where the Data Librarian governs the quality of content, the System Administrator governs the quality of configuration, ensuring that the platform remains structured, secure, and future-ready.


#### 2. Key Responsibilities

| **Area**                 | **Responsibilities** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Platform Configuration** | - Manage all settings within Content Hub  <br/> - Configure pages, components, and user experiences  <br/> - Maintain and optimise media processing and rendition settings |
| **Data Schema Governance** | - Design and maintain a clean, scalable data schema  <br/> - Prevent duplication of entities (e.g. brands, geographies)  <br/> - Ensure schema aligns with Sitecore’s best practice architecture |
| **Integration Management** | - Configure and maintain integrations with external systems (e.g. PIM, CMS, ERP)  <br/> - Ensure data flows are secure, reliable, and well-documented |
| **Environment Lifecycle** | - Manage development, QA, and production environments  <br/> - Oversee deployment processes and configuration migration  <br/> - Ensure consistency and integrity across environments |
| **Security & Permissions** | - Define and manage user groups, roles, and access permissions  <br/> - Implement least-privilege access models |
| **Collaboration & Support** | - Work closely with the Data Librarian to align schema and taxonomy  <br/> - Support content teams by enabling platform capabilities  <br/> - Act as a technical point of contact for escalations and enhancements |
