Configuration refers to the process of customizing and tailoring the platform to align with the specific needs of your organization. This involves setting up and managing the structure, workflows, permissions, and functionalities of the platform to optimize the way digital assets, metadata, and processes are handled. It allows businesses to adapt the out-of-the-box Content Hub capabilities to their unique requirements.
