Schema Management refers to the process of defining, organizing, and managing the data structure within the platform. The schema governs how content, assets, and metadata are represented, connected, and interacted with. It forms the backbone of how data is stored, retrieved, and utilized, ensuring consistency and efficiency in managing digital assets and content workflows.
