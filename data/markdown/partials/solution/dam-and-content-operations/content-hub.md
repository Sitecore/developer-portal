| [Triggers](https://docs.stylelabs.com/contenthub/4.0.x/content/integrations/integration-components/triggers/overview.html)                           | Triggers are a push mechanism in Sitecore Content Hub that executes certain actions if certain conditions are met after specific events occur. Triggers are defined by a set of triggering events (Objectives), a set of conditions, and a set of actions. <br/> <br/> Triggers can be used as a push mechanism towards external systems by making API calls (e.g. invoke an Azure Function) or by publishing messages to an Azure Service Bus queue or an Azure Event Hub. |
| [Actions](https://docs.stylelabs.com/contenthub/4.0.x/content/integrations/integration-components/actions/overview.html)                             | Actions are extensible objects that can be included in other page components (e.g. selection component) and that can execute a specific task like running a predefined script, making an external API call and publishing messages to an Azure Service Bus queue or an Azure Event Hub.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Scripts](https://docs.stylelabs.com/contenthub/4.0.x/content/integrations/scripting-api/scripting-api-overview.html)                                | Sitecore Content Hub allows users to integrate custom scripts in their business logic. Scripts can be manually triggered by end-users or automatically triggered by the application (e.g. using Triggers) depending on the script type and the use case. Sitecore Content Hub offers different script types, with each type having different context properties.                                                                                                            |

The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. The CLI is used for communicating with Sitecore Content Hub&trade; instances through the REST API using the C# Web SDK.                                                                                                                                       |
