## Introduction

Containers are executable units of software that code is packaged in, along with libraries and dependencies, so that it can be run anywhere, whether on a developer's workstation, an on-prem server, or in the cloud, and deployed easily and consistently, regardless of the target environment.

There are a number of reasons why the use of containers is attractive for Sitecore development, and it becomes even more attractive as Sitecore moves towards a microservices-based architecture. Containers lend themselves very well to this architecture (and in fact encourage it).
