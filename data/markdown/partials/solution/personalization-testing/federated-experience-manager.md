## Federated Experience Manager

The Federated Experience Manager (FXM) is an application that allows you to add Sitecore content on external non-Sitecore websites as well as track visitor interactions and generate analytics. You can use FXM to implement personalization rules, create goals and events, and implement content profiling on an external website. You can also implement rules that include non-Sitecore sites in engagement plans, as well as track traffic from the external website in Experience Analytics.
