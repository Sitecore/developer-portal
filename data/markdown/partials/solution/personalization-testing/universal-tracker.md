## Universal Tracker

The Sitecore Universal Tracker (UT) lets you collect data from different sources as the interaction occurs and process the data when the interaction is completed. The Universal Tracker comes with a REST request-response model that allows capturing remote interactions that get stored and processed in Sitecore.
