## Introduction

The trial will teach you the basics of JSS, step by step. Additionally, you will get a taste of Sitecore's personalization capabilities, one of its most powerful features — it's what distinguishes it from other CMSs. The developer trial program offers a pre-configured Sitecore instance, access to guided learning materials, community portals for peer-to-peer support and advanced notice on developer events and giveaways

## Prerequisites

This trial is recommended for JavaScript developers who have at least a basic understanding of modern front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. There are no operating system requirements — use whichever one you like best!
