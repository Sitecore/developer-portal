## Data Generation for xProfile

### Interact with the app to generate data for xProfile

1. From the front-end on your local connected app (http://localhost:3000/), select the "Personalize" item from the upper right corner drop-down menu.

   NOTE: if you see any errors when opening your connected app, it may be because the cookies from the Sitecore instance are interfering. If you are logged into Sitecore in the same browser, then it's best to open the local app in an incognito instance.

2. Select "Basketball".

3. Move the Skill Level slider to "Expert" and click the "Continue" button.

4. In the "Demographics" screen, enter whatever you'd like and click the "Continue" button.

5. In the "Personal" screen, enter a sample email and name and click the "Continue" button.

   NOTE: This does not have to be a real email address, it only needs to be something you can remember so that you can locate it in the Experience Profile later on.

6. In the "Finish" screen, click the "Home" button. It will provide you with an experience personalized to your stated interest in basketball.

7. Favorite a few of the events by clicking into the event and then clicking on the heart button in the upper right corner. Be sure to favorite and then unfavorite at least one.

   NOTE: The Google Maps will not work on the local application because the Google Maps API keys are not set.

    NOTE: The notifications will not work on the local application because the Firebase API keys are not set.

12. Feel free to explore the app. Once you are done with your independent exploring, go back to the home page.

13. Use the upper right drop-down menu and click on the "End Current Session" item.
