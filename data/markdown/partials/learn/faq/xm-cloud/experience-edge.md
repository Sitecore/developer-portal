## How is content delivery connected with Experience Edge?
XM Cloud publishes and serves content exclusively to Experience Edge. The Edge for XM Connector is preconfigured as part of the XM cloud solution. Edge is a content delivery network (CDN) that uses a set of GraphQL libraries which your front-end application uses to retrieve content.

## Is Experience Edge only available to customers using Sitecore Managed Cloud and the future XM Cloud?
Experience Edge is available today for both Content Hub and Experience Manager customers regardless of whether they are self-hosted, or using Sitecore Managed Cloud or XM Cloud.

## Does Experience Edge come bundled with the XM Cloud subscription?
XM Cloud is anticipated to bundle Experience Manager, Pages, Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA), Headless Services, the Sitecore Next.js SDK, and Experience Edge together in a single subscription.

## With XM Cloud, will there always be an Experience Edge tenant?
Since XM Cloud will not utilize Content Delivery servers, developers will need to use the Experience Edge endpoint to query item and layout data build-time for static site generation, at runtime for server-side rendering or incremental static generation, and directly from the browser for client-side rendering. Experience Edge will not be hosting the public-facing application.

## Does relying on Experience Edge for all content and Layout services come with any limitations for multi-language and multi-site?
Experience edge will be able to handle these scenarios. The biggest change here is that switching sites/languages will need to be handled on the front end. i.e. you can't get the automatic language context switching you are used to when running on a server-side content delivery instance.
