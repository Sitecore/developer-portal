## Can an integration be made with Salesforce?
A team can do a Salesforce integration if they have licensed Sitecore CDP, or they could do a bespoke Salesforce integration. 

See more on [integration between Sitecore CDP and Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://www.sitecore.com/products/marketplace/tap/cdp/sitecore-cdp-connector-for-salesforce-marketing-cloud).

## Is there no more support for front-end search out of the box? Is it required either provision another Solr instance, or use Coveo or another search vendor?
Sitecore XM Cloud is focused on a being an API-first, headless, composable, content management solution. Sitecore will be offering a separate composable site search offering for front end websites.
