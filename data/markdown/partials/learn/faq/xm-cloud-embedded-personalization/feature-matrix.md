### When using the personalization inside XM Cloud approach, does that mean there is no access to the Sitecore CDP/Personalize SaaS interface at all for customers? Is the tenant provisioned, just not accessible?

For embedded personalization, it is bundled directly into XM Cloud and there is no direct access to the Personalize tenant.

All the configuration of personalization would be handled from within XM Cloud. The embedded personalization functionality is quite limited, so there would be different cases you would still need to license a standalone product (Personalize, CDP).

### Does XM Cloud embedded personalization include API access to Sitecore Personalize?

XM Cloud Embedded Personalization (Inside Pages) does not include API access level to Sitecore Personalize. If a client is seeking full customizability or integration capabilities through the API, will need to purchase the Sitecore Personalize license.

### What can I Personalize with XM Cloud Personalization?

With Personalize, you create variants of a page that you assign audiences to, and the specified audiences will see that page variant when browsing your site.

Within each page variant, you personalize components either by changing the content source and updating the content, hiding that component, or replacing it with another compatible component. For more details, please
check: https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/edit-a-page-variant.html.

### Can I personalize to any level within the page hierarchy, inside pages tree?

Yes, any level in the site tree hierarchy can be personalized. However, if Page and Partial designs exist in the site tree, these cannot be personalized.

### Do I need to have a different subscription model to enable pages-level personalization inside my XM Cloud website?

No, you do not.

### Does XM Cloud Embedded Personalization support omni-channel and single channel personalization?

Personalization in XM Cloud is linked directly to the website that you create in the product.

### Can I Personalize Sitecore XM Cloud on the level of Components or data sources?

No. Personalization is applied at the page level, where a variant of the page gets assigned to a specified audience. Within that page variant, the user can choose to only personalize one component and leave the rest as default.

Personalization of content items is not supported, i.e., content items alone cannot be assigned to audiences and then applied to a page – personalization must be applied at page level and then content can be updated for that audience by creating or assigning a new content item.

### What is the difference(s) between using XM Cloud Embedded Personalization (inside Pages) and having a license for Sitecore Personalize integrated with my website?

XM Cloud included personalization has a fixed set of conditions allowing marketers to put together combinations of conditions. If clients want to create customized personalization conditions, they can license Sitecore Personalize and create additional condition license the broader Sitecore.
