### When using the personalization inside XM Cloud approach, does that mean there is no access to the Sitecore CDP/Personalize SaaS interface at all for customers? Is the tenant provisioned, just not accessible?

For embedded personalization, it is bundled directly into XM Cloud and there is no direct access to the Personalize tenant.

All the configuration of personalization would be handled from within XM Cloud. The embedded personalization functionality is quite limited, so there would be different cases you would still need to license a standalone product (Personalize, CDP).

### Does XM Cloud embedded personalization include API access to Sitecore Personalize?

### Do I need to have a different subscription model to enable pages-level personalization inside my XM Cloud website?

No. Personalization is applied at the page level, where a variant of the page gets assigned to a specified audience. Within that page variant, the user can choose to only personalize one component and leave the rest as default.

Personalization of content items is not supported, i.e., content items alone cannot be assigned to audiences and then applied to a page – personalization must be applied at page level and then content can be updated for that audience by creating or assigning a new content item.
