### How does Embedded Personalization work on Jamstack-ready architecture?

XM Cloud is a Jamstack ready application. It offers a decoupled architecture with a clear split between the server side and the client side.

Personalization inside pages works directly on the Edge where it serves the relevant content for the visitor based on the defined personalization rules.

Note: Jamstack is a different architecture for building apps and websites. It enabled modern web development architecture based on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup â€“ JAM. Instead of using a traditional CMS or site builder, a Jamstack site splits up the code (JavaScript), the site infrastructure (APIs), and the content - Markup.
