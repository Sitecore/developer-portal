**Is there security implemented to ensure that bad actors can't access my organization via the command line API?**

Yes, we have partnered with one of the top products in the industry and offer protections like brute-force protection, bot detection, and suspicious IP throttling to name a few. Our authentication/authorization code always checks that the actor trying to access the data of an organization has access to that organization.

**As a developer at a partner, how do I spin up a sandbox of a product to create a demo for a potential customer?**

If your partner organization has a Sitecore Cloud Portal account with an XM subscription, you will be able to spin up a non-production instance of XM Cloud for demo purposes. It is on our roadmap to provide this similar capability as we onboard additional products into Sitecore Cloud Portal.
